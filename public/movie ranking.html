 <h2>Pratyush's favourite movie of all time</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
 <p>All the philosophical dilemma that has been shown in this movie makes it GOATED. Spider-man is a the hero we all love but this movie shows us that Peter Parker is the real hero. He is the one who is beaten down to a point where he has to choose between the hero he wants to become sacrificing the life as Peter Parker.</p>

 <h3>Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>This movie shows how gullible common people can be. You have to be strong and stand with your morals and belief unlike Harvey Dent. From his POV he might be right but all the crimes he did under the influence of Joker becoming Two Face was not justified. Batman suffered the same loss as him but he stood with his morals and belief.</p>

 <h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>
 <p>The shock value and bulding tensions between characters in this film makes this movie so much rewatchable. Everything you expect from Tarantino is in this movie if not more.  </p>
